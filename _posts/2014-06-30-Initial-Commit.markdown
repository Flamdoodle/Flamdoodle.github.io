title:  "Initial Commit"

First post, time to start with a clean slate.  This is where I start a new project with a world of possibilities ahead of me.  It's my initial commmit.

The purpose of this blog is to remind myself how far I've come, teach others not to make the same mistakes I have, and to open others up to interesting new technologies.

For now, my languages of choice are Ruby and JavaScript.  However, don't be surprised if you see Python, Java, Swift, or anything else that I might find interesting along the way sneak in here.

So `bundle` up, ride `shotgun`, and `git` ready for the start of something new.

I am also so very sorry for the almost-puns, don't `git blame` me.
