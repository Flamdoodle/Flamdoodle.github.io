First post, time to start with a clean slate.  This is where I start a new project with a world of possibilities ahead of me.  It's my initial commmit.

The purpose of this blog is to remind myself how far I've come, teach others not to make the same mistakes I have, and to open others up to interesting new technologies.

We're starting with a blank slate here, so let's have some fun...

Since I'm still doing some experimenting with Jekyll, this will be changed in the future.  However, we can all expect a post about this process soon.
