<h3>Who is Flamdoodle?</h3>


That's me!  I'm Stephen Roth, a developer in the greater NYC area.  I love to learn, and it's this that led me to the wonderful word of programming.  There is always something new to explore, a better way of solving a problem, or a way to make others' lives easier, and I constantly aim to learn these and implement them in my code.  Whether it's on projects with friends or a team of professionals, I look forward to applying my talents and being proud of a product that I've helped build.

Speaking of, have you heard about [SmartiPants][smartipants]?  It's a totally awesome memory game that makes you smarter.  This is backed by **science** (which you can read more about on the site).  I built it with some friends.  Check it out.

You've heard of that one?  Well then how about "[What's This?][whatsthis]"?  It's an equally awesome - though far more hilarious - game that is based on the popular party game usually called Pictionary Telephone.  This one doesn't make you smarter, but looking at the finished games is hilarious.  It's currently being rewritten from the ground up, so be on the lookout for a cleaner, faster, prettier, and more user friendly version soon!

**UPDATE :D** Not a fan of games?  I worked on a project that I can finally tell the world about!  It's called **Shipstr**, and I can't link you to it yet because it's not ready for the public, but you may have seen it come in second at TechCrunch Disrupt's [Startup Battlefield][startup_battlefield] in San Fransisco!  It'll streamline the process of booking overseas shipping, allowing small and medium businesses to thrive with little hassle and saving them lots of money.  It's a great idea that my friend Max Lock came up with, and I was lucky enough to help put it together for him.

Now that we're past the shameless plugs, I want to say that not only do I love to learn, but I love to help others learn as well.  Helping others where I have struggled is a wonderful feeling, and it is for this reason I have begun this chronicle of my coding experience.  If there is some cool new tool that I've found, you can bet I'll help you initially set it up here.  Did I make a huge mistake that other programmers could as well, or get stuck on something that wasn't obvious for hours?  Yep, those will be here too.

I hope that you learn something by reading this, and have a good time too.  Be prepared for some laughs, code, facepalms, learning, and maybe just a little bit of flamdoodle.
